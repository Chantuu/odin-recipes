        <p>While I know no one is ever actually scared by spooky Halloween treats, I do know for a fact that many people are terrified to work with meringue.</p>
        <p>Hopefully these bones and ghosts will help chase those demons away.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large egg whites</li>
            <li>2 drops fresh lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>chocolate chips, melted, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Baking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs whites and lemon juice together in a bowl until thick, white, and foamy. Add sugar a spoonful at a time,
                <p>whisking constantly, until meringue is shiny, thick, and holds its shape.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Transfer meringue to a piping bag. Pipe 12 bone shapes onto a prepared baking sheet. Pipe 12 puffs to resemble ghosts onto the remaining baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dried and firm, about 1 hour. Turn off the oven, close the door, and cool until completely dried, about 1 hour more.</li>
            <li>Dip the tip of a toothpick into melted chocolate and dot chocolate "eyes" on each of the ghosts.</li>
        </ol>
